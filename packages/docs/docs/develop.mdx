# Development

All NiiVue development is public on GitHub. The `main` branch represents the most current state of NiiVue. Contributions to NiiVue are encouraged and welcomed. 

## Local Development

The hot-reloadable web page is the most responsive way to test and develop new features in NiiVue. Whenever any core source files are modified, the page at /niivue/packages/niivue/src/index.html automatically reloads to reflect those changes. You can edit this index.html file to load specific datasets or create custom examples that demonstrate new functionality or reproduce issues.

```
git clone git@github.com:niivue/niivue.git
cd niivue
npm install
npm run dev
```

The [API documentation](https://niivue.com/docs/api/niivue/classes/Niivue) provides many live demos as recipes to illustrate the functionality. If you want to modify these demos, you can run them (though note that this mode is not hot-reloadable so you will have to re-run `npm run demo` after changing the core code).

```
git clone git@github.com:niivue/niivue.git
cd niivue
npm install
npm run demo
```

## Documentation Development

The [primary documentation](https://niivue.com/docs/) uses [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). The easiest way to enhance this documentation is to use the hot-reloadable mode, where changes in the code are rapidly reflected in the locally hosted web browser pages.

```
git clone git@github.com:niivue/niivue.git
cd niivue
npm install
npm run build:niivue
npm run dev:docs
```

Note the embedded [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/) annotations that describe the API and include links to live demos are also also compiled by `build:niivue` into [web pages](./api/niivue/classes/Niivue#methods).

## Alternatives

What makes NiiVue unique is its ability to simultaneously display all major neuroimaging data types in the browserâ€”including volumetric voxels, surface meshes, tractography streamlines, statistical overlays, and connectomes. This versatility makes it a strong candidate for integrated web-based visualization. However, before committing development resources to a single platform, it may be worth considering whether an alternative tool better suits your specific needs. Below are some alternative voxel-based web tools worth exploring:

 - [ami](https://fnndsc.github.io/ami/)
 - [BioImage Suite Web](https://bioimagesuiteweb.github.io/webapp/viewer.html)
 - [BrainBrowser](https://brainbrowser.cbrain.mcgill.ca/volume-viewer)
 - [nifti-drop](http://vsoch.github.io/nifti-drop)
 - [OHIF DICOM Viewer](https://viewer.ohif.org/)
 - [Papaya](https://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/ukbiobank/group_means/index.html)
 - [pycortex](https://github.com/gallantlab/pycortex)
 - [VTK.js](https://kitware.github.io/paraview-glance/app/)
